# What Color Is It?
### A watch face for Garmin watches where the background changes every minute.

The original plan to show the time in color (as originally done by http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/ ) did not work out. This is because the Garmin watches have a very limited range of colors. However, this watch face is still being developed into a complete watch face.

The watch face simply consists of a colored background that changes every minute, and a white bar across the bottom that tracks the percentage completion of the daily step goal.
The watch face also features a movement bar across the top of the layout that warns the user when they haven't moved in a while.

Possible new features and improvements:
- Handle military time option
- Show battery life
- Develop for circular watch faces
- Draw movement bar emoticons in code instead of shrunken pictures

# WhatColorIsItWatchFace
###A watch face for Garmin watches where the background changes every minute.

The original plan to show the time in color (as originally done by http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/ ) did not go as planned. This is because the Garmin watches have a very limited range of colors. However, this watch face is still being developed into a complete watch face.

This is the submission by Daniel Grooms and Shayna Oriold for the Garmin Just Code It competition, Summer 2015.

The watch face simply consists of a colored background that changes every minute, and a white bar across the bottom that tracks the percentage completion of the daily step goal.
